# Krait Package Monorepo

Krait is a Laravel package for creating VueJS Datatables with ease.
It creates all the front-end and back-end related resources with a simple CLI commands.

For a better consistency in the versioning and fixing some of the front-end codebase fundamental parts,
we decided to create a separate NPM package, called `krait-ui.

This is a monorepo that contains the related projects:
* `/krait-ui` - the VueJS DataTables UI kit
* `/krait` - the main Laravel package
